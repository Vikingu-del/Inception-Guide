# Choosing between Alpin Linux and Debian

Based on the requirements and considerations outlined in the project specifications, the best choice in my opinion will be Alpin Linux. Here's why:

➊ Performance

    Alpine Linux is known for its small size and minimalistic approach, which results in smaller Docker images compared to Debian.
    Since performance matters are emphasized in project requirements, choosing Alpine can help optimize resource usage and improve
    container performance.
➋ Security

    Alpine Linux is designed with security in mind and has a smaller attack surface compared to Debian. This aligns well with the
    security considerations mentioned in the project requirements.
➌ Docker Image Building

    We are required to write our own Dockerfiles and build Docker images ourself. Alpine's simplicity and minimalism can make it
    easier to create lightweight and efficient Docker images.
➍ TLS Configuration with NGINX

    Our project requires setting up an NGINX container with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 only. Since Alpine Linux provides NGINX packages and
    has a smaller footprint, it may be easier to configure and manage NGINX with Alpine.
➎ Volume and Network Configuration

    Alpine Linux support Docker volume and network configurations just like Debian, so there shouldn't be any significant differences
    in setting upvolumes and networks between the two distributions.
➏ Project Requirements

    Our project specifications do not explicitly favor Debian over Alpine or vice versa. Both distributions meet the project's
    requirments, but Alpine's smaller size, security features, and suitability for containerized environments make it a strong 
    candidate for this project.

Therefore, based on the outlined project requirements and considerations, Alpine Linux would be the recommended choice from my side to
use for your Docker containers.
